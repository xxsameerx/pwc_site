                        Patna Women’s College was founded in 1940 by Bishop B.J.
                        Sullivan S.J., Bishop of Patna and Mother M. Josephine
                        A.C. Superior General of the Apostolic Carmel. It was
                        the first institution of higher learning opened to cater
                        to the educational needs of women in Bihar. Bishop
                        Sullivan, the founder, named it Patna Women’s College
                        and presented it as a gift to the females of Bihar,
                        thereby placing at their disposal an opportunity for
                        higher education. It was Bishop Sullivan’s firm belief
                        that the upliftment of Bihar lay in liberating its
                        womenfolk by providing them with opportunities for
                        higher education i.e., by empowering them. In the early
                        years, the college and the hostel were housed in the
                        Bishop’s own residence at Bankipore, which he vacated
                        for this landmark. The college has come a long way from
                        the time the pioneers envisioned and undertook the
                        difficult task of establishing a women’s college at a
                        time when only a few truly enlightened and far-sighted
                        persons were prepared to support this infant project in
                        a place where higher education for women was frowned
                        upon, if not rejected outright
