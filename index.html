                        Patna Women’s College was founded in 1940 by Bishop B.J.
                        Sullivan S.J., Bishop of Patna and Mother
                        M. Josephine A.C. Superior General of the Apostolic
                        Carmel. It was the first institution of higher
                        learning opened to cater to the educational needs of
                        women in Bihar. Bishop Sullivan, the founder,
                        named it Patna Women’s College and presented it as a
                        gift to the females of Bihar, thereby placing at
                        their disposal an opportunity for higher education. It
                        was Bishop Sullivan’s firm belief that the
                        upliftment of Bihar lay in liberating its womenfolk by
                        providing them with opportunities for higher
                        education i.e., by empowering them. In the early years,
                        the college and the hostel were housed in
                        the Bishop’s own residence at Bankipore, which he
                        vacated for this landmark. The college has come a
                        long way from the time the pioneers envisioned and
                        undertook the difficult task of establishing a
                        women’s college at a time when only a few truly
                        enlightened and far-sighted persons were prepared
                        to support this infant project in a place where higher
                        education for women was frowned upon, if not
                        rejected outright
